    "## The UNION FIND Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem there is a set of $N$ objects and connections between objects. We postulate that there is an `union` command that connects two objects. Thus, given two objects, it provides a connection between them as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "union(1, 3)\n",
    "> {1,3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another command is the `connected` query, which verifies if there is a path connecting the two objects, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connected(1, 3)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the image below, we have a set of ten objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/rogergranada/MOOCs/master/Coursera/Princeton/Algorithms-Part-1/Week%201/images/dynamic_connectivity.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects were connected using the following sequence of commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "union(4, 3)\n",
    "union(3, 8)\n",
    "union(6, 5)\n",
    "union(9, 4)\n",
    "union(2, 1)\n",
    "union(5, 0)\n",
    "union(7, 2)\n",
    "union(6, 1)\n",
    "union(1, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can ask for connection between two objects as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connected(1, 8)\n",
    "> False\n",
    "\n",
    "connected(8, 9)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "\n",
    "connected(0, 7)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we ask for the connection between eight and nine, the system answer `True` since there is a path from eight to three to four to nine (8 $\\rightarrow$ 3 $\\rightarrow$ 4 $\\rightarrow$ 9). Understood this, we need a few abstract properties that these connections have to satisfy. We assume that *is connected to* is an equivalence relation, *i.e.*, every object is connected to itself. It is *symmetric* if $P$ is connected to $Q$, then $Q$ is connected to $P$. It is transitive if $P$ is connected to $Q$, and $Q$ is connected to $R$, then $P$ is connected to $R$. Thus, a connected component is a maximal set of objects that is mutually connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this small example below we have three connected components. One consisting of just object zero, second one with objects one, four and five; and the third one with the other four objects. \n",

So, for this example, we have a client that reads information from standard input. First, an integer which is the number of objects that are going to be processed. Then, a series of pairs of object names. What the client does first is to read the integer from standard input, and create a UF object. Then, as long as standard input is not empty, it is going to read two integers from the input. If they are not connected, then it connects them and print them out. If they are connected it ignores. That's our test client and that's a fine test client to make sure that any implementation does what we expect that it will. \n",

Unlike Quick-find, in quick-union an array represents a set of trees, where each entry in the array is going to contain a reference to its parent in the tree. Thus, each entry in the array has associated with it a root. Elements that are connected to their own component and point to themselves are roots.

As the roots are the same ids, we just set the value of the `index=4` to zero, indicating that the root of four is zero. Next, we apply `union(0, 7)`, indicating that the root of the tree containing zero is seven. Thus, we set the value of `index=0` to seven. In `union(9, 4)`, we see that the root of four is seven. Thus, we have to set the value of `index=9` as the root seven. In case of create a union of two components that have the same root, we keep the tree unchanged. For example, we apply `union(0, 9)` and do not change the tree since both have the same root.\n"

    "Weighted quick-union is a very effective improvement on quick-union. The idea is to process as quick-union but taking some steps to avoid having tall trees. Thus, if you have a large tree and a small tree to combine together, you should avoid putting the smaller tree under the larger, which would lead to long tall trees. In order to avoid large trees, we keep track of the number of objects in each tree and maintain balance by always making sure that we link the root of the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. The image below illustrates an example of this algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, when there is only two items to link, it works the same way as quick-union no matter which order their arguments came since both have the smaller tree. Thus, when performing `union(4, 0)` we can put any of them as root. Here we add zero as root of four. Next, when performing `union(0, 7)` we have to add the element to keep the smallest tree. Thus, unlike quick-union where we add zero to the root seven, in weighted quick-union we add seven to the root zero, keeping a tree with two nodes deep instead of tree nodes deep. When applying `union(9, 4)`, we add nine to the root of four as it would occur in quick-union. This process continues up to the last node being added. \n",

While we are doing that, we might as well make each one of those just point to the root. We can easlily do this by making every other node in the path point to its grandparent on the way up the tree. In the image below we can see on the left side a complete tree in which we are going to apply `union(6, 3)`. Thus, we are going to add the tree containing 6 to the tree containing 3. We discover that the root of the tree is zero, then, we add the tree of root six to the root zero. In the path to discover the root, we also have the nodes `3` and  `1`. Thus, we set the root of `3` as the root of the tree and keep the root of `1` as `0` since it is the root of the tree.\n",

On the other hand, when the probability is close to the half, it's questionable whether it percolates or not.

Every time we add an open site, we check to see if it makes the system percolate.

    "1. **Social network connectivity**. Given a social network containing $n$ members and a log file containing $m$ timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (*i.e.*, every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be $m \\log n$ or better and use extra space proportional to $n$.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: I think this could be developed by implementing the weighted quick-union find algorithm, where the timestamp is sorted in ascending order. First, we check the number of members in the log. Then, for each pair of members in the log, we perform `union()` and count how many members are connected. In case the number of connected members is equal to n-1, we stop adding new members and check the last timestamp.\n",

    "2. **Union-find with specific canonical element**. Add a method `find()` to the union-find data type so that `find(i)` returns the largest element in the connected component containing $i$. The operations, `union()`, `connected()`, and `find()` should all take logarithmic time or better. For example, if one of the connected components is $\\{1, 2, 6, 9\\}$, then the `find()` method should return $9$ for each of the four elements in the connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: In this case, the union-find algorithm could have another list that stores the largest value when performing the `union()` operation. This largest value is related to the root of each tree. Thus, when computing the `find()` of a set, we have to only check the value associated with the root. \n",
