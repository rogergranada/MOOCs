    "- Observational: Collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise (\"observe\"). It only stablishes an association. In other words, correlation between the explanatory and the response variables. If an observational study uses data from the past, it's called a *retrospective* study.

    "On the other hand, in an experiment, we sample a group of people from the population, then we randomly assign these people into two groups. Those who will regularly work out through the course of the study and those who will not. The difference is that the decision of whether to work out or not is not left up to the subjects as in the observational study, but is instead imposed by the researcher. At the end, we compare the average energy levels of the two groups based on the observational study even if we find the difference between the average energy levels of these two groups of people, we can't attribute this difference solely to working out. Because there may be other variables that we didn't control for in this study, that contribute to the observed difference. For example, people who are in better shape might be more likely to regularly work out and also have higher energy levels. However, in the experiment, such variables that might also contribute to the outcome are likely equally represented in the two groups due to the random assignment. Therefore, if we find a difference between the two averages, we can indeed make a colossal statement attributing this difference to working out.\n",

    "## Sampling and Source of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources of sampling bias**\n",
    "- Convenience sample bias: It occurs when individuals who are easily accessible, are more likely to be included in the sample. For example, say you want to find out how people in your city feel about a recent increase in public transportation costs. If you only poll people in your neighborhood, as opposed to a representative sample from the whole city, tour study would suffer from convenience bias.\n",
    "- Non-response: It happens if only a non-random fraction of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey, such that the sample is no longer representative of the population. For example, say you take a random sample of individuals from your city, and attempt to survey them, but certain segments of the population, say those from a lower socioeconomic status, are less likely to respond to the survey. \n",
    "- Voluntary response bias: It occurs when the sample consists of only people who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue. For example, say you place polling machines at all bus stops and metro stations in your city, but only those who choose to do so actually take the time to vote and express their opinion on the recent increase on public transportation costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling Methods**\n",
    "- Simple random sampling: we randomly select cases from the population, such that each case is equally likely to be selected. This is similar to randomly drawing names from a hat. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"center\" width=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rogergranada/MOOCs@1b8b7bf5/Coursera/Duke%20University/Probability-intro/Week%201/images/srs.svg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stratified sampling: we first divide the population into homogenous groups called strata, and then randomly sample from within each stratum. For example, if we wanted to make sure both genders are equally represented in a study, we might divide the population first into males and females, and then randomly sample from within each group.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Cluster sampling: we divide the population into clusters, randomly sample a few clusters, and then sample all observation within these clusters. The clusters, unlike strata and stratified sampling, are heterogeneous within themselves, and each cluster is similar to another, such that we can get away with just sampling from a few of the clusters. \n",

    "<img align=\"center\" width=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rogergranada/MOOCs@ce1513c9/Coursera/Duke%20University/Probability-intro/Week%201/images/cluster_sample.svg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multistage sampling: we divide the population into clusters, randomly sample a few clusters, and then we randomly sample observations from within these clusters. Usually, we use cluster sampling and multistage sampling for economical reasons. For example, one might divide a city into geographic regions that are on average similar to each other, and then sample randomly a few of these regions, go to these randomly picked regions, and then, sample a few people from within these regions. This avoids the need to travel to all of the regions in the city. \n",

To do so, we divide our sample into pro and amateur athletes, and then, we randomly assign pro and amateur athletes to treatment and control groups, therefore, pro and amateur athletes are equally represented in the resulting treatment and control groups. This way, if we do find a difference in running speed between the treatment and control groups we will be able to attribute it to the treatment, the energy gel, and can be assured that the difference isn't due to pro status since both pro and amateur athletes were equally represented in the treatment and control groups.\n",

This would be an ideal experiment, but site studies are usually difficult to carry out, especially if the experimental units are humans, since it may be difficult to randomly sample people from the population, and then impose treatments on them. This is why most experiments recruit volunteer subjects. You may have seen ads for these on a university campus, or in a newspaper.  \n",

    "Such human experiments that rely on volunteers employ random assignment, but not random sampling. These studies can be used to make causal conclusions, but the conclusions only apply to the sample, and the results cannot be generalized. A study that uses no random assignment, but does use random sampling, is your typical observational study. Results can only be used to make correlation statements, but they can be generalized to the population at large. A final type of study, one that doesn't use random assignment or random sampling, can only be used to make correlational statements, and these conclusions are not generalizable. This is an un ideal observational study. \n",
