    "### Milgram's Experiment \n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted by Stanley Milgram, a Yale University psychologist, starting in the 1960s. These experiments measured willingness of participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience. The experimenter orders the teacher to give severe electric shocks to a learner each time the learner answers a question incorrectly. The teacher is the subject of the study and the learner is actually just an actor and the electric shocks are not real but pre-recorded sound is played each time the teacher administers an electric shock. So they actually think that they're really shocking these people. Milgram found that about 65% of people would obey authority and give such shocks. Over the years, additional research suggested this number is approximately consistent across communities and time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each person in Milgram's experiment can be thought of as a trial. \n",
    "- A person is labeled a **success** if she refuses to administer a severe shock, and **failure** if she administers such a shock. \n",
    "- Since only 35% of people refused to administer such a shock the probability of success is `p = 0.35`. \n",
    "- When an individual trial has only two possible outcomes like the one here, it is called a **Bernouilli random variable**.\n",
    "\n",

The probability associated with refusing is 0.35, and the probability associated with all the rest is 0.65. Since we're saying that the first person will refuse, and the second person will shock, and the third person will shock, and the fourth person will shock, when we'd say and, and these are remember independent trials because since these are a random sample of people, we multiply these probabilities. So the probability associated with this first scenario, first person refuses and everybody else shocks, is 0.0961.\n",

    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernouilli trials with probability of success, $p$. We show that this probability can be calculated as the product of the number of scenarios times the probability of a single scenario. The probability of a single scenario is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{single scenario}) = p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p^k$ is the probability of success to the $k$ number of successes, and $(1-p)^{(n-k)}$ is the probability of failure, to the power of number of failures. To find the number of scenarios we actually enumerated each possible scenario, but this was only feasible since there were only four of them. If there were many more, say we were looking for how many scenarios for four success in 100 trials, this method would be very tedious, and also very error prone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we usually use an alternative approach, namely the choose function which is useful for calculating the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials ($n$ choose $k$). To evaluate this function, we perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How many scenarios yield one success in four trials?\n",

    "$\\binom{4}{1} = \\frac{4}{1} = 4$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How many scenarios yield two successes and nine trials?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could try to make it manually, as we did with the earlier example. Thus, the first two might be successes and the reminder failures. The first one might be a success. The second one a failure. The third one a success and the remainder failures. We could also have the first and the fourth one successes and the remainder are failures and this could go on and on.\n",

    "$$SFSFFFFFF$$\n",
    "$$SFFSFFFFF$$\n",
    "$$SFFFSFFFF$$\n",
    "$$...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously this is not the way to go, so we'll use the choose function. So, we know that our $n=9$ and $k=2$. Applying in the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$<br>\n",

    "$\\binom{4}{1} = \\frac{9\\times8}{2\\times1} = 36$<br>\n",

    "These hand calculations are nice, but to speed things up we can also use computation. In R the associated function is also called `choose` and it takes two arguments $n$ and $k$."

    "Let's increase the sample size a bit keeping $p$ constant at 0.25. With $n$ equals 20 we see a change in the center of the distribution, which is expected since $n\\times p$ is now different. We also see a change in the shape. The distribution, while still right-skewed, is looking much less skewed. Increasing the sample size further to 50, the distribution looks even more symmetric, and much smoother, and increasing the sample size even further to 100, the distribution looks no different than the normal distribution. \n",

Users in the sample pressed the like button next to friends' content an average of 14 times, but had their content liked an average of 20 times. Users sent 9 personal message on average but received 12. 12% of users tagged their friend in a photo, but 35% were themselves tagged in a photo.

The blue-shaded area of interest can just as well be calculated as the area under the smooth normal curve that closely resembles the more jagged binomial distribution.
