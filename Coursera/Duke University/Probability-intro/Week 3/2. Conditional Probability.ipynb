    "In the Bayesian approach, we evaluate claims iteratively as we collect more data. In the next iteration, the next roll, if we were to play this game one more time, and you had asked me to roll a die on either the right or the left hand again, and we had done the calculation of the posterior one more time. We get to take advantage of what we learned from the data. In other words, we **update** our prior with our posterior probability from the previous iteration. So, in the next iteration, our updated prior for the first hypothesis being true is going to be the 60%, the posterior from the previous iteration. And the compliment of that, 40%, is going to be the probability of the competing hypothesis. \n",
