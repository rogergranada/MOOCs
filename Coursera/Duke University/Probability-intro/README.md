This folder contains codes to the [Introduction to Probability and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/) course by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel. According to the description presented in the web site:

> This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.
