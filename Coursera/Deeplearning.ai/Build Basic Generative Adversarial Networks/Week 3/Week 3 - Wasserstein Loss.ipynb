    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Last lesson we gave to the GAN a little bit of an upgrade to generate images better. This week we will explore another major issue with GAN training. That's with a **GAN generating the same thing each time**. A GAN trained on all different dog breeds will only generate a golden retriever. This issue happens because the discriminator improves but it gets stuck between saying an image of a dog looks extremely fake or extremely real. As a classifier, it's encouraged to say it's one real or zero fake as it gets better. But in a single round of training, if the discriminator only thinks the generator's golden retriever looks real, even if it doesn't even look that real. Then, the generator will cling on to that golden retriever and only produce golden retrievers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now when the discriminator learns that this golden retriever is fake in the next round of training, the generator won't know where to go because there's really nothing else it has in its arsenal of different images and that's the end of learning. The end of learning is very, very bad for these networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digging one level deeper, this happens due to the binary cross-entropy loss, where the discriminator is forced to produce a value between zero or one, and even though there's an infinite number of decimal values between zero and one, it will approach zero and one as it gets better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will be introduced to a new loss function that allows a discriminator to say -4 or +100 (any number between negative infinity and infinity), which mitigates this problem and allows both networks to keep on learning."

    "A **mode** in a distribution of data is just an area with a high concentration of observations. For instance, the mean value in a normal distribution is the single mode of that distribution. There are certainly distributions with multiple modes where the mean doesn't have to be one of them. In the distribution below, that's bimodal, i.e., it has two modes, or multimodal, meaning it has multiple modes. \n",

It would be probably a mixture of seven and five. However, there's a very low probability that you would see that $x_1$, $x_2$ pair in this in-between space, that would produce an intermediate five seven looking number. \n",

This probability density distribution over these features, $x_1$ and $x_2$, will have 10 modes, one for each of these digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many real life distributions used for training GANs are multimodal. Take a discriminator that has learned to be good at identifying which handwritten digits are fakes, except for cases where the generated images look like `1` and `7`. This could mean the discriminator is at of local minima of its cost function. The discriminator classifies most of the digits correctly, except for the ones that resembled those ones and sevens, then this information is passed on to the generator. The generator sees this and looks at the feedback from the discriminator and gets a good idea of how to fool the discriminator in the next round. It sees that all the images were misclassified by the discriminator, resemble either a one or a seven, so it generates a lot of pictures that resemble either of those numbers. Then these generated images are then passed on to the discriminator in the next round who then misclassifies every picture except for maybe the one felt looks more like a seven. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generator gets that feedback and sees that the discriminator's weakness is with the pictures that resembled a handwritten one, so this time all the pictures it produces resembled that digit, collapsing to a single mode or the whole distribution of possible handwritten digits. Eventually the discriminator will probably catch on and learn to catch the generator's fake handwritten number ones by getting out of that local minima. However, the generator could also migrate to another mode of the distribution and again would collapse again to a different mode. Or the generator would not be able to figure out where else to diversify. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, modes are peaks and the probability distribution of our features. Real-world datasets have many modes related to each possible class within them, like the digits in this dataset of handwritten digits. Mode collapse happens when the generator learns to fool the discriminator by producing examples from a single class from the whole training dataset like handwritten number ones. This is unfortunate because, while the generator is optimizing to fool the discriminator, that's not what you ultimately want your generator to do."

The generator wants to maximize this cost because that means the discriminator is doing poorly and is classifying it's fake values into reals. Whereas the discriminator wants to minimize this cost function because that means it's classifying things correctly. Of course the generator only sees the fake side of things, so it actually doesn't see anything about the reals. This maximization and minimization is often called a `minimax` game. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this **minimax** game, the generator and discriminator interaction translates to a more general objective for the whole GAN architecture. That is to make the real in generated data distributions of features very similar. Trying to get the generated distribution to be as close as possible to the reals. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, let's take a step back again to the generator and discriminators roles. The discriminator and again, needs to output just a single value prediction within zero and one. Whereas the generator actually needs to produce a pretty complex output composed of multiple features to try and fool the discriminator, for example, an image. As a result that discriminators job tends to be a little bit easier. To put it in another way, it's more straightforward to look at images in a museum than it is to paint those masterpieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "During training it's possible for the discriminator to outperform the generator, very possible, in fact, quite common. But at the beginning of training, this isn't such a big problem because the discriminator isn't that good. It has trouble distinguishing the generated and real distributions. There's some overlap and it's not quite sure. As a result, it's able to give useful feedback in the form of a non-zero gradient back to the generator. \n",

Even though there is an infinite number of decimal values between zero and one, the discriminator, as it improves, will be pushing towards those ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "So take this generated and real distributions with the same variance but different means, and assume they might be normal distributions. What the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) does, is it measures how different these two distributions are, by estimating the amount of effort it takes to make the generated distribution equal to the real. \n",

So to that end, first we'll see an alternative way to look at the BCE Loss function that's more simple and compact, and then we will see how W-Loss is calculated and compared this loss with BCE Loss. \n",

    "BCE Loss is computed by a long equation that essentially measures how bad, on average, some observations are being classified by the discriminator, as fake and real.

However, it does look very similar to the simplified form for the BCE Loss, and in this case the function calculates the difference between the expected values of the predictions of the discriminator (it's called the **critic** and is represented with a $c$ here). This is $c$ of a real example $x$, versus $c$ of a fake example $g(z)$. Generator taking in a noise vector to produce a fake image $g(z)$, or perhaps you can call it $\\hat{x}$.\n",

And so the discriminator's neural network for GANs, trained with BCE Loss, have a sigmoid activation function in the output layer to then squash the values between 0 and 1. W-Loss, however, doesn't have that requirement at all, so you can actually have a linear layer at the end of the discriminator's neural network, and that could produce any real value output. And you can interpret that output as, how real an image is considered by the critic. It's no longer bounded between 0 and 1, where 0 means fake, and 1 means real. It's no longer classifying into these two, or discriminating between these two classes. And so, as a result, it wouldn't make that much sense to call that neural network a discriminator, because it doesn't discriminate between the classes. For W-Loss, the equivalent to a discriminator is called a **critic**, and what it tries to do is, maximize the distance between its evaluation on a fake, and its evaluation on a real.\n",

    "So, some of the main differences between W-Loss and BCE Loss is that, the discriminator under BCE Loss outputs a value between 0 and 1, while the critic in W-Loss will output any number. Additionally, the forms of the cost functions is very similar, but W-Loss doesn't have any logarithms within it, and that's because it's a measure of how far the prediction of the critic for the real is from its prediction on the fake. Meanwhile, BCE Loss does measure that distance between fake or a real, but to a ground truth of 1 or 0. And so what's important to take away here is largely that, the discriminator is bounded between 0 and 1, whereas the critic is no longer bounded ,and just trying to separate the two distributions as much as possible. And as a result, because it's not bounded, the critic is allowed to improve without degrading its feedback back to the generator. And this is because, it doesn't have a vanishing gradient problem, and this will mitigate against mode collapse, because the generator will always get useful feedback back. \n",

To check if a function here, for example, this function you see here, $f(x)=x^2$, is 1-Lipschitz Continuous, you want to go along every point in this function and make sure its slope is less than or equal to one, or its gradient is less than or equal to one.

Basically what that means is that weights over that interval, either too high or too low, will be set to the maximum or the minimum amount allowed. That's clipping the weights there. This is one way of enforcing the 1-L continuity, but it has a way to downside. Forcing the weights of the critic to a limited range of values could limit the critics ability to learn and ultimately for the gradient to perform because if the critic can't take on many different parameter values, it's weights can't take on many different values, it might not be able to improve easily or find good loop optimal for it to be in. Not only is this trying to do 1-L continuity enforcement, this might also limit the critic too much.
