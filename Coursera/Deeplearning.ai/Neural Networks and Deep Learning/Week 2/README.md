# Neural Network Basics

Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

## Learning Objectives

- Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network
- Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
- Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
- Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
- Become familiar with Python and Numpy
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples
