    "## Resolving Merge Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "If you perform a merge with a merge commit, Git takes on the responsibility of combining the work of multiple branches and placing the result into a single merge commit. Git will try to do this automatically. However, there are cases where multiple branches make different changes to the same part of a file. In that case, a merge conflict occurs and a person needs to make a decision on [how to resolve it](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we start with commit `A` on the `master` branch. That commit contains a `fileA.txt` file, containing the string `'feature 1'`. Then, let's say that you create a `feature2` branch based on commit `A`. While you are working on the `feature2` branch, someone makes commit `C` on the `master` branch. Commit `C` contains a `fileA.txt` file that includes the string `'feature 3'` as the second line of the file. Now, let's say that you have finished `'feature 2'` and made a commit `B` on the `feature2` branch, commit `B` contains a string `'feature 2'` as the second line of the `fileA.txt` file. Now, you are ready to merge your `'feature 2'` work into the `master` branch. You cannot use a fast forward merge because commit `C` has been made to the `master` branch after you created the `feature2` branch. When you perform a merge, Git tries to automatically create a merge commit combining the work of commits `B` and `C`. However, when Git tries to combine the work, it notices that the second line of `fileA.txt` is different on each branch. Git doesn't know how to write `fileA.txt` and you have a merge conflict. A person needs to decide how to write `fileA.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/merge_branches.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just seen that a merge conflict can occur if different branches change the same part of a file in different ways. If only one branch changes any file, you'll not have a merge conflict. In this example, the `feature2` branch adds a new file, `fileB.txt`, to implement `'feature 2'`. There is no merge conflict because changes are made to separate files. Commit `C` changed `fileA.txt`, and commit `B` created `fileB.txt` after the merge, commit `M` contains the two files implementing the three features. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/merge_branches_file.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Git also can automatically merge changes to different parts of the same file. In Git, a part of a file is called a **hunk**. In the example below, the project starts with commit `A` which contains a `fileA.txt` file containing `'feature 1' with a bug` and `'feature 2'`. A `feature3` branch is created off of commit `A` of the `master` branch. While the `feature3` branch is being worked on, commit `C` is made which fixes the bug in `'feature 1'`. On the `feature3` branch, the string `'feature 3'` is appended to the `fileA.txt` file as commit `B`. Notice that the `feature3` branch has the bug because the bug was there when the branch was created. When the `feature3` branch is finished, a merge will execute without a merge conflict. Git is smart enough to realize that the first part of the file was changed on the `master` branch, and the last part of the file was changed on the `feature3` branch. In merge commit `M`, Git will automatically create the `fileA.txt` file, shown here. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/merge_branches_bug.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "How Git actually merges the files depends on what is called, the [merge strategy](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies). Usually, the default merge strategy works well. We have seen that merge conflicts occur when two branches modify the same hunk of the same file. To make merging easier, avoid making a lot of changes over a long period of time without merging. Smaller frequent mergers are usually the best approach. It's better to create many small merge problems than one giant merge problem. If your project is a software project, decoupled modular code is much less likely to have merged conflicts. In some ways, the number and complexity of merge conflicts is a test of how modular your code is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving a merge conflict between two branches involves three commits. Let's look at a simple example to help understand these three commits. In this commit graph, the project starts with commit `A` on the master branch, a `featureX` branch was created off of commit `A`. Commit `B` was then made to the `master` branch, then commit `C` was made to the `featureX` branch. Let's assume that we are finished with `featureX` and want to merge it into the `master` branch, we've checked out the `master` branch, as you can see from the `HEAD` reference pointing to the `master` branch label. The first commit involved with resolving a merge conflict is the commit at the tip of the current branch. We call this commit, **ours** or **mine**. In our example, the current branch is the `master` branch and the tip is commit `B`. The second commit involved with resolving emerge conflict is the commit at the tip of the branch to be merged. We call this commit, **theirs**. In our example, the branch to be merged is the `feature X` branch and the tip is commit `C`. The final commit involved with resolving a two-branch merge conflict is the common ancestor of the two branches. We call this commit, the **merge base**. In our example, the most recent commit that both branches contain is commit `A`, so commit `A` is our merge base. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/merge_scheme.svg\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic steps to resolve a merge conflict. You start out just like with any other merge by checking out the base branch. In this case, the base branch is the `master` branch. You then attempt to merge the `feature X` branch into the `master` branch. Git will inform you that there is a merge conflict, both branches modified the same hunk in `fileA.txt` in different ways. At this point, Git has modified `fileA.txt`, showing you exactly where the conflicts are, and has placed the file in your working tree. You then open `fileA.txt` and resolved the merge conflict. This is the part that requires human judgment. Once `fileA.txt` looks the way that you want it to, you stage it so that it becomes part of the merge commit. You then commit the merge. At this point, the branches are merged. Just like with other merges, you can then optionally delete the `featureX` branch label. Thus, the steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Checkout master branch\n",
    "2. Merge featureX into the master branch  \n",
    "   a. CONFLICT: Both modified fileA.txt\n",
    "3. Open FileA.txt and fix the merging problem\n",
    "4. Stage fileA.txt\n",
    "5. Commit the merge commit\n",
    "6. Delete the featureX branch label\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point here is that, when attempting a merge, **files with conflicts are modified by Git and placed in the working tree**. You need to fix those files before executing a successful merge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, in `fileA.txt`, we have intentionally modified the same hunk in both branches so that a merge will result in a conflict. We see here that our starting commit graph has three commits. The original commit `'added feature 1'`. A `feature2` branch was made off of the original commit, and the commit was made to that branch. The current commit on the `master` branch `'added feature 3'`. We have checked out the `master` branch, as you can see from the `HEAD` reference. \n",

    "  * c431e4b added feature 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then try to merge in the `feature2` branch, Git tried automatically to perform a merge but ran into a conflict in `fileA.txt`. Git saw that we had modified the same hunk in conflicting ways on the two branches. You are asked to fix the conflicts and then commit the result. You have to fix the merge conflict before you can execute a successful merge. \n",

    "  Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then execute the Git status command to view information on the conflicted files that Git has placed in the working tree. The messages tell you that you have tried to merge but have unmerged paths. It tells you to fix and commit `fileA.txt`. Another option it mentions is to use the abort flag to abort this merge attempt. You can see that Git messages are very helpful. \n",

    "     (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n",
    "  Unmerged paths:\n",

    "  no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will have to fix the conflicted `fileA.txt`. You can use any editor that you want to fix the conflicted file. This can be a simple text editor, or a custom tool called a diff or merge tool. We'll keep it simple here and use a simple text editor. When you view `fileA.txt`, you can see that Git marked up the file in hunks where there are conflicts. Conflicted hunks are surrounded by less than (`<<<<<<`) and greater than (`>>>>>>`) signs that are called, **conflict markers**. This file has one conflicted hunk immediately after the `'feature one'` line. Any text that isn't surrounded by conflict markers was cleanly resolved by Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "feature1\n",
    "<<<<<< HEAD\n",

    "The first part of the conflict marker is labeled `head`. We have checked out the `master` branch, so this line is from the file in the `master` branch. This is the ours commit in the merge. After the equal signs is the line `'feature 2'`. This is labeled with the branch name, so this line comes from the `feature2` branch. This is that theirs commit in the merge. So basically, what happened is that, Git saw these changes and didn't know what line to a `fileA.txt` should say. That's why the merge conflict was presented, Git needed a human to make a decision. We can use our text editor to fix `fileA.txt`. We have ordered the features nicely in a file. This file will be part of the merge commit. \n",

    "Now that we have fixed `fileA.txt`, we can add it to the stage and commit the merge. We use the Git add command to add `fileA.txt` to the staging area. Then, we execute Git commit. Your default Git editor will appear with a default commit message. Edit that message if desired. The commit is then executed successfully, and the branches are merged. \n",

    "## Tracking Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tracking branch** is a local branch that represents a remote branch. Locally, a tracking branch name starts with `<remote>/<branch>` name. If you clone a repository, you'll have a default local tracking branch. In the example below, the remote repository contains a `master` branch with three commits. On the remote repository, the head reference points to the default branch that will be checked out when the repository is cloned. In this case, the default branch is named `master`. When we clone the remote repository, the same three commits, `master` branch label and `HEAD` reference will be copied to the local repository. You can see that the commit graph on the remote repository looks exactly like this part of the commit graph locally. After the clone, you will have the `master` branch checked out. You can see that there is an additional branch label on the local repository. This is the **tracking branch**. It represents the remote `master` branch, where `origin` is a shortcut for the URL to the remote repository, and `master` is the name of the branch on the remote repository. Because the clone just happened, these two repositories are synchronized. All of the `master` branch labels point to commit `C`. That includes the local `master` branch label, the tracking `master` branch label and the remote `master` branch label. You can see that these three branches are related. Right now they each contain the same three commits. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/clone.svg\" width=\"80%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tracking branch** is related to its associated *remote* branch and *local* branch, but they are decoupled. Tracking branches updates separately from both the *remote* branch and the *local* branch. This is because tracking branches are only updated with network commands like `clone`, `fetch`, `pull` and `push`. The tracking branch acts as a sort of intermediary between the *local* and *remote* branches. In this example, our tracking branch points to commit `C`. This means that at the time of the most recent network command, commit `C` was the latest commit on the remote `master` branch. Locally, we then created commit `D`. This moves the `HEAD` reference and `master` branch label to commit `D`. The tracking branch label stays behind because it only moves with network commands and committing is a local command. If we look at the remote repository, we can see that since our last network command, someone pushed a new commit `E`. We are now in a state where the three master branch labels point to different commits. The local master branch label points to commit `D`, the `master` tracking branch label points to commit `C`, and the *remote* `master` branch label points to commit `E`. The three related branches are no longer in sync. \n",

    "By default, the `git branch` command only lists the names of local branches, use the `--all` option of the `git branch` command to display all local and tracking branch names. Let's look at an example. First, we clone a remote repository named `projecte`. This will create a git managed directory named `projecte`. We then change to that directory. We first execute a `git branch` command. You can see that it shows only the local master branch and because of the asterisk, we have the `master branch` checked out. We then execute the `git branch` command passing in the `--all` option. The first branch is the local `master` branch. The second line is really not a unique branch, but is a symbolic reference that we will discuss shortly. The third line shows that we have a tracking branch that tracks the `master` branch on the remote repository. This tracking branch was created automatically during the `git clone`. If you look at this list, only the first and third lines represent unique branches, with the second line representing a symbolic reference to an existing branch. When using the `--all` option with the `git branch` command, we saw that there is a reference named `remote/origin/head`. This is a symbolic reference, meaning that it is a reference that points to another reference. This specifies the default remote tracking branch. This allows you to only type the remote name instead of the whole tracking branch name in git commands. \n",

This create a merge commit for every pull that downloads commits. The `--ff-only` option only accepts fast-forward merges. It will cancel the merge rather than perform a merge commit. You will then have to decide how to deal with the merge using a separate command. There is also a `--rebase` option which we will talk about later.\n",

If we perform a pull, commit `C` will be fetched, and the tracking branch label will point to it. Because we haven't made any commits to the `master` branch locally that aren't on the remote repository, a fast forward merge is then performed. This simply moves the `master` branch label and `HEAD` reference to commit `C`. After executing the pull, the local and remote branches are synchronized.\n",

What probably happened is that we fetched when there were two commits on the remote repository. Someone then made and pushed commit `C` sometime before we made commit `D`. When we execute a pull, first the fetch happens. Commit `C` is retrieved from `origin`, and the tracking branch label then points to commit `C`. That is the same as the tip of the remote repository. After the fetch, the tracking branch is merged into the local `master` branch, creating merge commit `E`. The merge commit is necessary because commits `D` and `C` both think that commit `B` is its parent. Notice that the tracking branch label stays behind because we merged into\n",

    "## Rebasing\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">The topics discussed here rewrite the commit history, so this should be done with caution.</font> There is a general rule related to **Rebase**. Do not rewrite history that has been shared with others. If you've been working locally or if you know that no one else has used your branch you can safely Rebase it. There are two types of Rebase, a **regular Rebase** and an **interactive Rebase**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rebase moves commits to a new parent or base. If we look at the example on the left, we have a situation that would typically involve a `merge commit` because commit `D` has been made after the `featureX` branch was made. However, there is another option and that is to rebase. What rebasing does is take commit `B` and `C` and moves them to a new parent commit `D`. The result is that you no longer need a merge commit and the merge can be fast forwarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rebase.svg\" width=\"90%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the commits have been moved, they are reapplied on top of the new commit. This creates a different ancestor chain and as a result each of the commit IDs change. So, in this example commit `B` changes to `B'` and commit `C` changes to `C'`. You can see that this is necessary because before the rebase commit `B`'s parent was `A`, and after the rebase commit `B` prime's parent is `D`. To help understand how Rebasing works, we can look at Diffs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rebase_ab.svg\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that each commit contains a snapshot of the complete project, however, it can calculate the difference between two commits. This is known as a `diff` or a `patch`. So commit `A` has the entire project, commit `B` has the entire project. It can calculate `diffAB` which is the difference between commits `A` and `B`. The same goes for commits `B` and `C`, where `diffBC` is the difference between commits `B` and `C`. When rebasing, git applies the diffs to the new parent commit. This is called \"reapplying commits\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the before commit graph on the left, we can see that the parent of `B` is `A` and the parent of `C` is `B` and the difference between `B` and `A` is `diffAB` and the difference between `C` and `B` is `diffBC`. With rebasing, Git takes the difference between `A` and `B` and\n",

    "Reapplying commits is a form of merge and is susceptible to merge conflicts. If we look at this simple example commit `B` change `fileA.txt` one way and commit `C` changed `fileA.txt` in a different way. Reapplying commit `B` onto commit `C` creates a merge conflict because Git does not know how to write `fileA.txt`. \n",

    "Rebasing has **pros** and **cons**, the pros are that you can incorporate changes from the parent branch, so if that branch has new features or bug fixes, you will see them. The tests on your branch are using more current code and because you are keeping up with the changes on other branches the eventual merge into the base branch will be easier. Another big advantage of Rebasing is that it avoids unnecessary merge commits. You can then have a very well-defined and clean commit history. The downside of Rebasing is it's a form of merge, so merge conflicts may need to be resolved. We've also pointed out that if you've already shared your commits that can cause problems because the commit IDs change in a Rebase. Finally, with the Rebase you are not preserving the commit history, you are rewriting the commit history.\n",

    "the currently checked out branch to the tip of the upstream branch. In the second option, you don't have to check out the feature branch first, you specify it as the second argument of the `git rebase` command.

    "## Rewriting History\n",
    "\n",
    "This video discusses Rewriting History.\n",
    "We will start by talking about amending a commit.\n",
    "You can change the most recent commit. This includes changing the commit message and/or changing the project files. This creates a new SHA-1 rewriting the history of the commit.\n",
    "Let's look at an example.\n",
    "First we will create fileC.txt.\n",
    "We then add it to the staging area, And then we commit it with a typo in the commit message.\n",
    "If we look at the most recent commit we can see our SHA-1 and our typo. We execute git commit again specifying the amend option and fix our typo in the commit message. We then again look at the most recent commit and we can see that we have fixed the commit message and we can see that the SHA-1 is now different from the original SHA-1. In addition to amending the most recent commit message, you can change the files of the commit. You do this by modifying the staging area and then again executing git commit with the amend option. If you want to keep the old commit message you can add the no-edit option. Let's take a look at an example. First we'll view our most recent commit then we'll change the content of fileC.txt.\n",
    "We'll add that file to the staging area then we execute git commit with the amend option and the no-edit option. This will change the commit to include the updated filesC.text.\n",
    "We can then again view the most recent commit and we can see that we have a new SHA-1 as well as updated fileC.text.\n",
    "Next we will discuss interactive rebase.\n",
    "Interactive rebase lets you edit commits using commands. The commits can belong to any branch and can in fact belong to a single branch.\n",
    "The commit history is changed, so in general do not use interactive rebase if you have shared commits.\n",
    "Interactive mode of the git rebase command is turned with the -i option, and as an argument you specify a commit. The children of those commits can be modified. In this example, before an interactive rebase, we have a single master branch with three commits, A, B, and C.\n",
    "And, after the rebase we have combined commits B and C into a single commit B prime.\n",
    "You can use interactive rebase to change a branch in many ways. You can use a commit from the branch as is, you can edit a commit message,\n",
    "you can stop the interactive rebase and edit the commit. You can drop or delete the commit. You can squash or fix up the commits, which we'll talk about a little later. You can reorder the commits and you can include shell commands to execute during the interactive rebase.\n",
    "This is an example of the editor and we have two commits associated with the interactive rebase. Git provides you with these comments to help you with the interactive rebase.\n",
    "You can change the command on each line. Here we are picking both of the commits meaning that we are using the commits.\n",
    "You can change that command to reword to edit the commit message,\n",
    "change it to edit to use the commit but to stop and amend the commit. Squash to use the commit but combine it with the previous commit, fix up is like a squash but you don't combine the commit messages.\n",
    "Exec is used to run a shell command anywhere in the interactive rebase and d or drop is used to remove a commit. If you re-order the commits, they will be reapplied in that order.\n",
    "If you remove or comment out of line, that commit will be deleted. If you remove everything from the list, the rebase will be aborted.\n",
    "Let's look at an example where we edit a commit. Before the rebase, we have three commits A, B, and C, in commit B we have a typo in the file name and as well as in the commit message. After the interactive rebase, we've fixed the file name and the commit message. Because history has been rewritten, the commit ID changes from B to B-prime and from C to C-prime.\n",
    "Here we look at the commit graph and we can see that the second commit has a typo. It also has an error in the file name. Since we want to change the second commit, we can execute git rebase with the -i option respecify the SHA-1 of the original commit. So we can work with the children of that commit which includes the commit with the typo When we execute the git rebase with the interactive mode, this screen shows up. We can change the pick command to edit for the fileB.txt commit. This means that when git is reapplying the commits, it will stop on this commit.\n",
    "After saving the file, git executes the rebase and stops on the commit that we want to edit.\n",
    "You can see that git tells you what state you are in and what you can do.\n",
    "If we list the contents of the working tree, we can see that we are on the commit that needs editing.\n",
    "At this point we can rename the file to fix the typo in the file name. We can execute git status, and git tells us that an interactive rebase is in progress, and provides information on what to do next. You can see that we've deleted a file, and added a new file.\n",
    "At this point we can add the files to the staging area and then execute git commit with the amend option. We can also fix the commit message.\n",
    "Git shows you that you're in a detached HEAD state. And this is because the interactive rebase paused on the commit that you wanted to edit.\n",
    "At this point we can execute git rebase, the continued option to reapply the rest of the commits to the branch.\n",
    "We look at our commit graph and we now see that the second commit has been fixed.\n",
    "If we list the files of the working tree, we see that our file name has been fixed as well.\n",
    "Next we will delete a commit and when we do this we're saying that we do not want to use any of the work of the commit. This can occur if you've made a mistake for example.\n",
    "Here we look at our commit graph and we see that in the initial commit we added fileA.txt, in the second commit we added fileB.txt, and in the most recent commit, we've added fileC.txt. If we list the contents of our working tree, we see the three files. Now let's assume for some reason we don't mean fileB.txt. We can execute the interactive rebase specifying the initial commit, allowing to delete the second commit.\n",
    "The editor comes up and we can change the command pick to drop for the commit associated with fileB.text.\n",
    "After we save the file, the rebase will be performed and the commit will be deleted.\n",
    "We can view the commit graph and see that the commit related to fileB.txt has been deleted. We can view the contents of the working tree and see that fileB.txt has also been deleted. The work of that commit is gone.\n",
    "Another option is to squash a commit. And this does three main things. It applies the newer squashed commit to an older commit. It combines the commit messages, and then removes the newer commit.\n",
    "Another related option is called fixup and it's like the squash, but the newer commit's message is discarded. Let's look at in the example.\n",
    "Here we view our commit graft and we see that we have three commits. The first added fileA.txt, second added fileB.txt, and the third added fileC.txt. Let's say that we would like to squash the most recent commit combining it's work with the second commit.\n",
    "If we view the contents of the working tree, we can see the three files.\n",
    "Now let's say that we would like to squash the most recent commit into the second commit, combining the work of the two commits.\n",
    "We execute the interactive rebase specifying the initial commit so we can work on its children.\n",
    "The editor appears and we change the pick command to squash for the most recent commit. This will combine the work of both of these commits.\n",
    "At this point, you can edit the commit message, which by default, combines the commit messages of the two commits.\n",
    "When we save the fie the interactive rebase is executed and the two commits are combined into a single commit.\n",
    "We can view the commit graph and see that we we now have two commits.\n",
    "If we view the contents of the working tree we see that all three files are there. Squashing the commits did not result in any work being lost.\n",
    "Let's look at the difference between squash and delete. Squash combines the commit with the older commit, creating a single commit. The work of both commits is included.\n",
    "In the case of delete, none of the changes from this commit are applied to other commits. All of the changes are thrown out.\n",
    "The work of the commit is lost and there is a greater chance of a merge conflict.\n",
    "This is because some of the transitional work between commits may be deleted.\n",
    "Here is an example of squash versus delete. Before an interactive rebase we have three commits. In commit A we add fileA.text, commit B we add fileB.txt and commit C we add fileC.txt. If we execute an interactive rebase and squash commit C, we are left two commits. Commit B prime contains all three files and we have not lost any of the work.\n",
    "If we perform an interactive rebase and delete commit B, we are left with two commits and fileB.txt is no longer part of our work entry.\n",
    "Next we will discuss Squash Merges.\n",
    "A squash merge merges the tip of the feature branch under the tip of the base branch. Because it is a a merge, there is a chance of a merge conflict. It places the results of this merge into the staging area which then can be committed. If we look before the squash merge, we have four commits, two on the master branch, and two on the featureX branch. After the squash merge, we combine commits C and D into a new commit E. You now have a simple linear history but commits B and D are no longer in the commit graph.\n",
    "After the featureX label is deleted commits B and D no longer are part of named branch. They will eventually be garbage collected by git. You can see that a squash merge simplifies things but it also rewrites the commit history.\n",
    "To perform a squash merge, you check out the master branch and then execute git merge with the squash option and specify the featureX branch as the argument. This adds the merged content to the staging area and you execute git commit to create the squash merge commit. You can then delete the featureX branch.\n",
    "You an also squash merge with the fast forward, you again check out the master branch. You execute git merge with the squash option and featureX branch specified as an argument. You execute git commit and the merge will automatically be fast forwarded. You can then delete the featureX branch.\n",
    "You can see, before the merge, we had three commits on two branches and after the squash merge we have two commits on the single master branch. Commits C and C prime contain the same project files, there is just a different commit history.\n",
    "Here is a review of what we've discussed in this video.\n",
    "You can amend the most recent commit's message and/or its committed files. This will create a new SHA-1 for the commit.\n",
    "Interactive rebase allows you to rewrite the history of a branch.\n",
    "A squash reduces multiple commits into a single commit.\n",
    "Now it is time for you to work with the topics discussed in this video. Separate hands on instructions that are provided."
