According to the description presented in the web site:

> The course will teach you how to develop Deep Learning models using Pytorch while providing the necessary deep-learning background.
> 
> We'll start off with PyTorch's tensors and its Automatic Differentiation package. Then we'll cover different Deep Learning models in each section, beginning with fundamentals such as Linear Regression and logistic/softmax regression.
We'll then move on to Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers.
> 
> In the final part of the course, we'll focus on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning (pre-trained models). Several other Deep Learning methods will also be covered..


## What you'll learn
- Explain and apply knowledge of Deep Neural Networks and related machine learning methods;
- Know how to use Python, and Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas along with the PyTorch library for Deep Learning applications;
- Build Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch.
