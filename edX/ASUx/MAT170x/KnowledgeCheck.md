What is the value of $y$ in the formulae $\sqrt{y+9} = 5$?

$ (\sqrt{y+9})^2 = 5^2 $
$ y + 9 = 25 $
$ y = 25 -9 $
$ y = 16 $

## Domain and range of a function

The **domain** of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable, i.e., the set of all possible $x$-values which will make the function "work", and will output real y-values.

The **range** of a function is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable after we have substituted the domain, i.e., the resulting $y$-values we get after substituting all the possible x-values.
