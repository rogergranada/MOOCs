> This course is part of Global Freshman Academy (GFA), which means you can earn transferable ASU credit toward your college degree. In this college-level Precalculus course, you will prepare for calculus by focusing on quantitative reasoning and functions. Youâ€™ll develop the skills to describe the behavior and properties of linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, rational, and trigonometric functions.
> 
> Content in this course will be adaptive, allowing you to achieve mastery in a certain concept before moving on to the next. Utilizing the ALEKS learning system, students in this personalized, self-paced course will be instructed on the topics they are most ready to learn while also providing individualized coaching as you move through each topic.
> 
> Before taking this course, you should already have a strong understanding of algebraic skills such as factoring, basic equation solving, and the rules of exponents and radicals. This 3 credit hour course satisfies the Mathematical Studies (MA) general studies requirement at Arizona State University. This course may satisfy a general education requirement at other institutions; however, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.
